<h1> Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace</h1>

<h2> Ada Lovelace Introduction</h2>

<p> Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was born Augusta Ada Byron, the only <em>legitimate</em> child of Annabella Milbanke and the poet Lord Byron. Her mother, <strong>Lady Byron</strong>, had mathematical training (Byron called her his 'Princess of Parallelograms') and insisted that Ada, who was tutored privately, study mathematics too - an unusual education for a woman.  </p>
<h2> Charles Babbage Introduction </h2>
<div> <img height = "200" width = "150" src = "AllImages/Babbage.jpg" alt = "Charles Babbage"> </div>
<p> Charles Babbage was born on December 26, 1791, the son of Benjamin Babbage, a <em>London banker</em>. As a youth Babbage was his own instructor in algebra, of which he was passionately fond, and was well read in the continental mathematics of his day. Upon entering<strong> Trinity College, Cambridge</strong>, in 1811, he found himself far in advance of his tutors in mathematics. Babbage co-founded the Analytical Society for promoting continental mathematics and reforming the mathematics of Newton then taught at the university.</p>

<p style = "line-height:2"> Ada met Babbage at a party in 1833 when she was seventeen and was entranced when Babbage demonstrated the <em>small working section of the Engine</em> to her. She intermitted her mathematical studies for marriage and motherhood but resumed when domestic duties allowed. In 1843 she published a translation from the French of an article on the Analytical Engine by an Italian engineer,<strong> Luigi Menabrea</strong>, to which Ada added extensive notes of her own. The Notes included the first published description of a stepwise sequence of operations for solving certain mathematical problems and Ada is often referred to as 'the first programmer'. The collaboration with Babbage was close and biographers debate the extent and originality of Ada's contribution. </p>
