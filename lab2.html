<h2> Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<blockquote>  I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
Who said "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away." </blockquote>

<h2> Benjamin Franklin </h2>

<p>  Benjamin Franklin at the age of  17 proposed to a very young Deborah. Wary of allowing her daughter to marry him, because of his lack of finances and connection to London's Governor, Sir William Keith, her mother initially declined his request. Deborah was
married to a man named John Rodgers, which proved to be a poor decision as John avoided his debts and left her behind. As she was not free to remarry due to bigamy laws, Franklin established the common-law marriage with her on September 1, 1730. They had two children,
namely,  Francis Franklin and Sarah Franklin. Francis died of smallpox shortly. They also had an illegimatge son named William. </p>

<p> Franklin's beliefs followed the 13 virtues of  Temperance, Silence, Order, Resolution, Frugality, Industry, Sincerity, Justice, Moderation, Cleanliness, Tranquility, Chastiity, and Humility. </p>

<p> Benjamin Franklin was an American scientist, writer and philosopher. He was one of the founding fathers of the USA, who signed the "Declaration of Independence" and "the United Stated Constitution" on 1776 and 1787 respectively. He was famous for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity.</p>
